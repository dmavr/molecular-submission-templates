# Molecular Submission Templates

This repository contains csv templates to prepare submission of molecular data to the appropriat archives (ENA,PANGAEA) via the GFBio brokerage service.

## Status

Under development! Frequent changes are expected, we will prepare proper releases once stable versions exist. Documentation will be extended and improved ASAP.

## Template Description

* There are currently three templates - samples, mixs, full (combination of the previous two). The **samples** template refers to general information about the samples (title, taxonomy, sequencing procedure), while the **mixs** template refers to metadata according to the MIxS community standard.

* The templates are comma separated (CSV) and all fields are quoted
* The first 10 fields of the **samples** template are mandatory
* All fields of the **mixs** template are required in order to comply to the MIxS standard. In some cases additional infromation might be required - you will be contacted by our curatorial team if that applies to you.
* Detailed explanation of each field will be added here ASAP.

## Template Usage
* Once the latets version of the GFBio brokerage system for molecular data has been released (planned for beginning of February 2017), you will be able to upload one or more of the templates via the GFBio portal [molecular submission interface](www.gfbio.org/data/submit/molecular).
